  <p> My name is Marc. I'm 22. Originally from Singapore, I've spent most of my life
  on the West Coast of Canada. Currently, I'm in the final stretch of my undergraduate
  studies at the University of Victoria, pursuing an honours degree in mathematics.
  My academic interests lie in mathematics, physics, computer science and philosophy.
  I'm particularly fascinated by how these fields intersect, especially in
  cognitive science and learning.
  </p>
  
  <p> Outside of that, I enjoy resistance training, cooking, chess, and playing the
  piano and guitar. I also appreciate spending time outdoors, and through
  photography, I try to capture the feeling of a peaceful landscape and the busy
  nature of everyday life in similar spirits. I write about some of my
  hobbies and interests, among other things, <a href="log.html">here</a>.</p>
