    <p>
      My name is Marc. I'm 22. I'm originally from Singapore, but I've spent most of my life on the
      West Coast of Canada.
      
      Currently, I'm in the final stretch of my undergraduate studies at the
      University of Victoria, pursuing an honours degree in mathematics.

      My academic interests lie in mathematics, physics, computer science and philosophy.


      I'm particularly fascinated by how these fields intersect, especially in cognitive science and
      learning.

      Outside of that, I enjoy the gym, cooking, chess, and playing the piano and guitar.

      I also
      enjoy nature and like spending time outdoors, shooting photographs.
